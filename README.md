# Ex-Tracker Project

## Description
This application is used to help me avoid running into my 'ex'. When the user loads the page, they see a comprehensive list of locations--displayed as cards--that my ex frequents. The user can interact with the app in the following ways: 
- Using the search bar. On keypress, the card or cards that match the user input will appear
- Using the filter by time of day feature. On click, the card or cards that match the time of day selection will appear. 

Concepts covered: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript/ES6, JSON, AJAX, Node.JS/Grunt/Browserify, and DOM manipulation.
