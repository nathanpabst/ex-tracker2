# Ex-Tracker Project

## Description
This application is used to help me avoid running into one of my 'exes'. When the user loads the page, they see a few of my exes along with a comprehensive list of locations--displayed as cards--that my exes frequent. The user can interact with the app in the following ways:
- Using the search bar. On keypress, the location card or cards that match the user input will appear
- Using the filter by time of day feature. On click, the location card or cards that match the time of day selection will appear.
- Clicking View on any of the 'ex' cards.
- Clicking the Back button to return to the home page.

Concepts covered: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript/ES6, JSON, AJAX, Node.JS/Grunt/Browserify, and DOM manipulation.
